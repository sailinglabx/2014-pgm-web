            <h2>Course Project</h2>


            <p>Your class project is an opportunity for you to explore an
            interesting problem in the context of a real-world data sets.
            <strong> Projects should be done in teams of three students.
            </strong> Each project will be assigned a TA as a project
            consultant/mentor; instructors and TAs will consult with you on
            your ideas, but of course the final responsibility to define and
            execute an interesting piece of work is yours. Your project will
            be worth 40% of your final class grade, and will have 4
            deliverables: </p>

            </p>

            <h3 id="Team_Formation">Team Formation</h3>

	    <p>You are responsible for forming project teams of 3 people by Friday, January 31st. In some cases, we will also accept teams of 2, but a 3-person group is preferred. Once you have formed your group, please send one email per team to the class instructor list with the names of all team members. If you have trouble forming a group, please send us an email and we will help you find project partners. </p>

	    <h3 id="Project_Suggestions">Project Suggestions</h3>

	    Please see the list of suggested projects <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jxAcUZdGXAkD7TNxYoeR6W5w_4wNJr5DhPgSc7K3WN0/pub">posted here</a>.

            <h3 id="Project_Proposal">Project Proposal</h3>


            <p>You must turn in a brief project proposal that provides an overview 
	      of your idea and also contains a brief survey of related work on the topic.  We will
            provide a list of suggested project ideas for you to choose from, and <strong>we strongly
              suggest using one of these ideas</strong>, though you may
            discuss other project ideas with us, whether applied or
            theoretical.  Note that even though you can use data sets you have
            used before, you cannot use work that you started prior to this
            class as your project. </p>

            <p>Proposals should be approximately two pages long, and should include
            the following information:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Project title and list of group members.</li>
              <li>Overview of project idea. This should be approximately half a page long. </li>
              <li>A short literature survey of 5 or more relevant papers. The
              literature review should take up approximately one page.</li>
              <li>Description of potential data sets to use for the experiments.</li>
		<li>Plan of activities, including what you plan to complete by the midway report and how you plan to divide up the work. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The grading breakdown for the proposal is as follows: </p>

            <ul>

              <li>40% for clear and concise description of proposed method</li>
              <li>40% for literature survey that covers at least 5 relevant papers</li>
              <li>10% for plan of activities</li>
	      <li>10% for quality of writing</li>

            </ul>

	      <p>The project proposal will be due on Monday, February 10th, and should be submitted electronically via Canvas.</p>

            <h3 id="Midway_Report">Midway Report</h3>


            <p>The midway report will serve as a check-point at the halfway mark of your project. It should be about 5 pages long, 
	      and should be formatted like a conference paper, with the following sections: 
            introduction, background & related work, methods, experiments, conclusion.  The
            introduction and related work sections should be in their final
            form; the section on the proposed methods should be almost
            finished; the sections on the experiments and conclusions will
            have the results you have obtained, perhaps with place-holders for
            the results you plan/hope to obtain. </p>

            <p>The grading breakdown for the midway report is as follows: </p>

            <ul>
	      <li>20% for introduction and literature survey</li>
              <li>40% for proposed method</li>
              <li>20% for the design of upcoming experiments and revised plan of activities (in an appendix, please show the old and new activity plans)</li>
	      
	      <li>10% for data collection and preliminary results</li>
	      <li>10% for quality of writing</li>
            </ul>

	      <p>The midway report will be due on Friday, March 28th, and should be submitted electronically via Canvas.</p>

            <h3 id="Final_Report">Final Report</h3>


            <p>Your final report is expected to be 8 pages (9 pages including
            references), in accordance with the length requirements for an ICML paper. 
            It should have roughly the following format: </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Introduction: problem definition and motivation </li>
	      <li>Background & Related Work: backround info and literature survey
              <li>Methods</li>
              <ul>
		<li>Overview of your proposed method
                <li>Intuition on why should it be better than the state of the art</li>
                <li>Details of models and algorithms that you developed</li>
              </ul>

              </ul>
              <li>Conclusion: discussion and future work</li>
            </ul>

	     The grading breakdown for the final report is as follows:
            <ul>
	      <li>10% for introduction and literature survey</li>
              <li>30% for proposed method (soundness and originality)</li>
              <li>30% for correctness, completeness, and difficulty of experiments and figures</li>
	      <li>10% for empirical and theoretical analysis of results and methods</li>
	      <li>20% for quality of writing (clarity, organization, flow, etc.) </li>
            </ul>

The final report will be due on Wednesday, May 7th, and should be submitted electronically via Canvas. Note that we will be posting all of the reports on the class webpage once the semester ends.

            <h3 id="Poster_Presentation">Presentation</h3>

            <p>All project teams will present their work at the end of the
            semester.  Each team will be given a timeslot during which they will give a slide
            presentation to the class, similar in style to a conference presentation. If applicable, live demonstrations of your software are highly encouraged. Details TBA.

            <h3 id="Peer_Reviews">Peer Reviews</h3>

	    <p>After all final reports have been submitted, we will assign each student to review the projects of two other groups and submit a written assessment similar in style to a conference referee report.

            <h3> 1) Personalize topic modelling </h3>

            Topic modelling is a useful way of organizing textual documents.
            Imagine the following scenario. We have a large set of  documents and
            each user only owns a portion of the entire dataset. And users usually
            have overlaps. How can we build a model that tailors individual users
            but also share the statistical strength among all other users? This
            can potentially provide better individual user experience.<p>

            Key points: model design, efficient inference and evaluation.<p>
